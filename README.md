# Strassen Experimentation

This repository's purpose is simply to give a gentle introduction to the usage of Python's TensorToolbox library, via implementation of Strassen's famous algorithm for matrix multiplication.

## Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of pip installed.

```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Now, visit [this link](https://pypi.org/project/TensorToolbox/) and follow the remaining instructions for installing the Tensor Toolbox.

## Why Strassen?

Strassen's algorithm was the first algorithm that showed matrix multiplication can be performed in faster than $O(n^3)$, and spurred the development of the entire field of research in matrix multiplication optimization. It's simple to understand by even the most uniformed reader, yet complicated enough to provide a moderate introductory challenge.
